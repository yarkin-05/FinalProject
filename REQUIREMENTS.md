Define Requirements:

Database System:
MySQL because it is simple and easy to use


Platform for app development: 
Progressive web app is the choice because:
  -works on any type of device (phones, desktops, etc) because there are no platform specific development
  -installation not required because it is accesible through URL
  -A single codebase serves all user (one platform)
  -Can work offline or with poor internet connection
  -engagement with distinct features
  -Discoverable (idk about that one for this case)
  -Update simplicity because it updates when refreshing the page
  -Served over HTTPS
  -Responsive Designs
  -User analytics
  -Lower data usage
  -no app store feed




Design the Database Schema:

Plan the structure of your database. Decide what tables you need, the fields in each table, and the relationships between them.

Registration table:
id AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY (for tracking the id of each child, in case two children have the same name, this will make them different to the server)
name 
contact phone
Diagnostico ( motriz, neurologico, conductual, lenguaje, social, otros)






Design the User Interface:

Design the forms for data entry. Make sure the interface is user-friendly and mobile-responsive.
Backend Development:

Develop the server-side logic to handle form submissions and interact with the database.
Choose a programming language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby) for your backend.
Implement APIs to send and receive data from the mobile app.
Frontend Development:

Build the mobile app's user interface.
Implement functionality to send data to the server when a form is submitted.
Security:

Implement proper security measures, including user authentication, to protect user data.
Testing:

Thoroughly test your app to ensure it works correctly, handles errors, and is user-friendly.
Deployment:

Deploy your backend to a server or cloud platform.
Publish your mobile app to the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android).
User Feedback and Improvements:

Gather user feedback and make improvements to your app.
Scaling:

Prepare for scaling as your user base grows. Optimize your database and server infrastructure for performance.
Maintenance:

Regularly maintain your app to fix bugs, update libraries, and add new features.
Legal Considerations:

Be aware of data protection and privacy laws that may apply to the data you're collecting.
Documentation:

Document your database schema, API endpoints, and codebase for future reference.
